## RCC Compilers
- `py`: [roblox-py](https://github.com/roblox-compilers/roblox-py) <br>
  Python -> Luau Compiler <br> <br>
- `c`/`cpp`: [roblox-c](https://github.com/roblox-compilers/roblox-c) [Archived] <br>
  C and C++ -> Luau Compiler <br> <br>
- `llvm` [roblox-llvm]() [Coming soon] <br>
  LLVM IR to Luau compiler. <br> <br>

***
## RCC Projects
- `bindgen`: [bindings](https://github.com/roblox-compilers/bindings) <br>
  Codegen to generate bindings in multiple langauges for the Roblox API <br> <br>
- `rcc`: [rcc](https://github.com/roblox-compilers/rcc) <br>
  Toolchain for installing and managing the RCC compilers. Allows for multiple languages to be used in one project and has extensive standard libraries. <br> <br>
- `install`: [installer](https://github.com/roblox-compilers/installer) [Experimental] <br>
  A shell-script for Unix & Windows systems to easily install `rcc` and compilers. <br> <br>
- `luau` [luau2py](https://github.com/roblox-compilers/luau2py) [In development] <br>
  Luau -> Python compiler.. <br> <br>


***
## Other Compilers
- [Wasynth](https://github.com/Rerumu/Wasynth):
WASM -> Luau, not very performant.
- [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com):
TS -> Luau, Very good Typescript to Luau compiler with many features.
- [roblox-rs](https://github.com/roblox-rs):
Rust bindings for Roblox STD, should be used with Wasynth.
- [roblox-cs](https://github.com/roblox-csharp/roblox-cs):
C# -> Luau, decent compiler in development
